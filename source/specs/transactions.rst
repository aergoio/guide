Payload
-------

A payload can be any kind of binary data, but is most often used with JSON strings for
`smart contract calls <contracts.html>`__.

Transaction types
-----------------

There are several types of transactions:

Normal (0)
^^^^^^^^^^

Deprecated. Normal transactions were used to transfer tokens and calling smart contracts.
Since version 2.0, there are more specialized transaction types that should be used instead.

Transfer (4)
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Transactions that only transfer native AERGO tokens.

Call (5)
^^^^^^^^

Used for calling functions on smart contracts.

MultiCall (7)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Used to call multiple contracts in a single transaction.

FeeDelegation (3)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fee delegation transactions are used for calling a smart contract while charging the fees to the contract.
This only works if the contract supports the `fee delegation interface <../smart-contracts/lua/using-fee-delegation.html>`_.

Deploy (6)
^^^^^^^^^^

Used to deploy contracts.

Redeploy (2)
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Used to re-deploy a contract. Only available in private networks.

Governance (1)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Governance transactions are used for calling system contracts, such as staking and voting.
Transactions of this type have a special payload format and recipient. See below for details.


Governance transaction details
------------------------------

The following table shows the specification for each field of the transaction body of a governance transaction:

===================  =========================  =================  =========================================================================================================================================

\* The amount needed for name transactions is determiend by the NAMEPRICE vote. It is currently 20 aergo on Mainnet. You can retrieve this information by accessing the network's ChainInfo.

The aergo.system transactions, including staking, unstaking and voting, can be sent once per 24 hours per account. The only exception is when you first vote.
For staking and unstaking, there is a limit to the amount of requests. It must be over 10000 aergo based on the amount of staked.
Therefore, the first staking request should exceed 10000 aergo, and in the case of the unstaking request, more than 10000 must be left or withdrawn altogether.

When voting for DAO, there are IDs by paramter. It will be changed to the new value when the first place gets 2/3 of the staking total.

GASPRICE             1 to 500000000000000000000000000  The price of gas
NAMEPRICE            1 to 500000000000000000000000000  The price of name transactions
===================  ================================  =========================================================================================================================================

The aergo.enterprise transactions are only for the private blockchain network. if you want to enable aergo.enterprise, you should make the genesis block with :code:`"public":"false"`

Transaction receipts
--------------------

.. seealso:: See `API â†’ Receipt <../api/rpc-autogenerated.html#receipt>`__ for a detailed explanation of all the receipt data.

Every transaction generates a receipt upon succesful execution which contains the result and metadata such as fee and gas used.
The :code:`status` can be one of three values:

SUCCESS
    Simple value transfer transactions and succesful contract executions.
    For contract calls, the result is available in :code:`ret`.

ERROR
    Failed contract execution. The error message can be found in :code:`ret`.

CREATED
    Succesful contract deployment transaction. The created address can be found in :code:`contractAddress`.
